# Classwork on Django Forms 1

Clone this starter code:

1. Add a new email field to the starter ```forms.py``` definition

2. Add the ```{% csrf_token %}``` entry to the proper file to allow the form to be submitted

3. Add a new URL entry field to the existing form in ```forms.py``` to allow users to type in their favorite website

4. Modify the ```views.form_name_view``` to print a message in the console when the form is submitted that says ```Favorite Website Entered Was: whatever.url.was.entered.com```

BONUS Add code to your view to validate that the user entered at least 3 words into the text field, and if not, raise a validation exception.
